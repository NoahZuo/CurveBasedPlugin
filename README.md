This is a ue4 plugin that contains some stuff curve based stuff. 

## What is so called "curve based stuff"?
You can control some properties with a curve asset. And the property would change with the time. 


## Why do we need it? 
Well... Think about it. When you are designing your enviroment and want to adjust the light intensity. And you want to make this value change with the time, and what would you do? 

You may think... Well, I'll add a timeline and change the value. 

Well that sound cool... But you cannot preview the effect in editor, can you? 

With this plugin, you can preview the timeline effect even in the editor! 

## What does it contains? 
Well... I just create curve based spotlight and point. You can control the intensity, color or parameters in Light function material!
